Every night in my dreams

I see you,I feel you

That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance

And spaces between us

You have come to show you go on

Near far

Wherever you are

I believe

That the heart does go on

Once more you open the door

And you're here in my heart

And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time

And last for a lifetime

And never let go till were one

Love was when I loved you

One true time I hold to

In my life well always go on

Near far

Wherever you are

I believe

That the heart does go on

Once more you open the door

And you're here in my heart

And my heart will go on and on

you're here

Theres nothing I fear

And I know

That my heart will go on

Well stay forever this way

You are safe in my heart

And my heart will go on and on

Again
Every night in my dreams

I see you,I feel you

That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance

And spaces between us

You have come to show you go on

Near far

Wherever you are

I believe

That the heart does go on

Once more you open the door

And you're here in my heart

And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time

And last for a lifetime

And never let go till were one

Love was when I loved you

One true time I hold to

In my life well always go on

Near far

Wherever you are

I believe

That the heart does go on

Once more you open the door

And you're here in my heart

And my heart will go on and on

you're here

Theres nothing I fear

And I know

That my heart will go on

Well stay forever this way

You are safe in my heart

And my heart will go on and on
